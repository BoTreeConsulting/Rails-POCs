Introduction:
	This is a Rails 3 application demonstrating Ruby Gem Devise for integrating authentication
	with minimal configuration in the application along with integrating Gem CanCan for authorization of
	actions invoked by the application.

Tutorial:

	The application is built by following the steps mentioned in file "Devise-CanCan-Tutorial"
	lying inside root folder of this Rails Application.

Use:

	To use the application follow below steps:

	1) Download it under a desired directory, say RailsApps

	2) Change directory to the application directory
			$cd rails3-devise-cancan
			
	3) Run Database Migrations using following command
			rails3-devise$ rake db:migrate
			
	   This should insert a default user named 'Admin User', having role 'Administrator' of 
	   of role type 1 which represents an Admin type user, into the default configured database, 
	   which is SQLite.
	   
	4) Startup the rails server
			rails3-devise$ rails s

	5) Open up a browser and hit http://localhost:3000		

	6) You should now be able to see a welcome page prompting to Log In or Sign Up
	   to access the application.

	7) Login with default user credentials :
		Email: admin@example.com
		Password: administrator
		
		This would show up following links at the top after successful sign-in:
		
		    a) Logout 
		    b) Edit account 
		    c) Manage Users 
		    d) Manage Roles 
		    e) Assign Roles 
		    
		    The last three links are accessible only to users who have a role assigned of role type 1 (Admin).
		
			If any user with role type 3 (User) logs in to the application he would be able to see only following links:
			 a) Logout 
		     b) Edit account
		     
	8) Signing Up with the application will register the user in the application, sign in the user and redirect to
	   User's Welcome Page, on successful sign up.By default a registered user will have permissions of role type
	   3 (User).Such a user can just view User Details, nothing else.
	   
	   The registration, sign-in, authentication part is taken care of by Ruby Gem Devise
	   The authorization i.e. verifying the permissions available, is taken care of by Ruby Gem CanCan.
	   
	   Note: The permissions are maintained in file app/models/Ability.rb
