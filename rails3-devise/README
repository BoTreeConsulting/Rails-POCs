Introduction:
	This is a Rails 3 application demonstrating Ruby Gem Devise for integrating authentication
	with minimal configuration in the application.

Home Page:
    https://github.com/plataformatec/devise

Wiki:
    https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki

Tutorial:

	The application is built by following a simple and great tutorial at http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-devise-rspec-cucumber.html

Use:

	To use the application follow below steps:

	1) Download it under a desired directory, say RailsApps

	2) Change directory to the application directory
			$cd rails3-devise
			
	3) Run Database Migrations using following command
			rails3-devise$ rake db:migrate
			
	   This should insert a default user named 'First User' into the default configured database, which is SQLite.
	   
	4) Startup the rails server
			rails3-devise$ rails s

	5) Open up a browser and hit http://localhost:3000		

	6) You should now be able to see a page showing 

		Login and Sign Up links along with listing the available users in the database.
		
	7) Clicking the user name should ask you to login to the application.This authentication is triggered by Ruby Gem Devise, if a user is 
	   not found logged in to the application.
	   
	   Default user login is :
			Email: user@example.com
			Password: please
		
	8) When logged in to the application only the logged in user's profile can be edited and not other's.

	Note: There is no Admin role available in the application as of now.
